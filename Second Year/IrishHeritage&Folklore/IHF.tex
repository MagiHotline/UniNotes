\section{Baile, Cell \& the built enviroment}

Many place-names in Irish tell you about the history or appeareance of the location. Sometimes the root words that make 
up a place-name can be difficult to see in modern english spellings.
\\
For example "Baile" means "settlment" or "town" and is often anglicised as "Bally". "Cell" means "church" and is often anglicised as "Kil".
\textbf{Dublin} is also called \textbf{Baile Atha Cliath} which means "town of the ford of the hurdles". The name comes from the viking settlement that was established in the 9th century.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fun fact: Baile can also mean "frenzy" or "madness" in Irish.
\end{itemize}
For example, Kilkenny is called \textbf{Cill Chainnigh} which means "church of St. Cainnech". 
Another example, Kildare is called \textbf{Cill Dara} which means "church of the oak". Saint Brigid founded a monastery in Kildare in the 5th century and was in she was a Goddess.
She is celebrated either in Catholicism and Paganism.

The island was abandoned in the 12th century. The island was used as a location for the Star Wars movie "The Force Awakens".

and Ràth is often anglicised as "Rath". Waterford is called \textbf{Port Láirge} which means "fort of the Vikings". The Vikings established a settlement in Waterford in the 9th century.

\section{Saint Brigid}

The feast day Saint Bridget of Kildar, also called St Brigid of Ireland, Patron Saint of Ireland, is February 1st, which is traditionally the beginnning of spring in Ireland.
The ancient celtic pagan feast is one of the quarter days of the year of the Celtic Calendar which marked the mid points between solstice dates, crucial days in the earth's journey around the sun.

\subsection{Background}

\begin{itemize}
    \item As it happens, this Celtic feast that is so much part of Irish Culture, was associated with the Celtic Goddess.
    \item Many Celtic feast days were adopted by the early Christians and their associations with the Celtic Goddesses were transferred to the Christian Saints.
    \item St. Brigid is associated with the Celtic Goddess Brigid.
    \item Her hermitage there was known as KillDara, "Church of the Oak".
    \item The customs associated with St. Brigid's Day are thought to have their origins in the pagan festival of Imbolc.
    \item For example, every other day between St. Brigid Day and St. Patrick's Day is supposed to be a fair day, according to Irish Folklore.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{St. Brigid's Cross}

In some parts of Ireland, children are still sent out on St. Bridget's Eve to pull up rushes which cannot be cut with a knife.
When the rushes are brought into the house they are strewn on the floor and over the windows and doors.
The crosses are made from rushes and are hung up in the house to protect the family from harm. They are made on January 31st, the are made from fresh rushes which are plentiful in Ireland.
When you give a St. Brigid's Cross to someone, you are giving them a blessing.
