Many place-names in Irish tell you about the history or appeareance of the location. Sometimes the root words that make 
up a place-name can be difficult to see in modern english spellings.
\\
For example "Baile" means "settlment" or "town" and is often anglicised as "Bally". "Cell" means "church" and is often anglicised as "Kil".
\textbf{Dublin} is also called \textbf{Baile Atha Cliath} which means "town of the ford of the hurdles". The name comes from the viking settlement that was established in the 9th century.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fun fact: Baile can also mean "frenzy" or "madness" in Irish.
\end{itemize}
