Ciao a tutti, ragazzi! I'm a native Italian speaker, currently living in Milan. I have a degree in English and French, which I got in Italy. I also have a degree in Italian Literature, which I got in the UK. I have taught Italian to foreign students in Italy and to Italian students in the UK. I have a real passion for languages, and I hope to share it with you!
