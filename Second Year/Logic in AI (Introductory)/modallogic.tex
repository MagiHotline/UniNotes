\section{What is a modal logic?}

In Modal logic are added modalities: $\square, \diamond.$ If $A$ is a formula then $\square A$ and $\diamond A$ are formulas
There are many type of modalities and meaning we can give to this operator such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Temporal 
    \item Epistemic
    \item Doxastic
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Semantic Models with Kripke}

Structure: $\mathcal{M} = \left<\mathcal{W}, \mathcal{R}, \rho\right>$
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{W}$ set of possible
    \item $\rho : \mathcal{W} \rightarrow 2^{AT}$
    \item $\mathcal{R} \subset \mathcal{W} x \mathcal{W}:$ accessability relation
\end{itemize}
There are different axioms in Normal Modal Logic such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Axiom K: $\square(A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow (\square A \rightarrow \square B)$ which is the kernel
    of the normal mode logic.
    \item Axiom D: $\square A \rightarrow \diamond B$
    \item Axiom T: $\square A \rightarrow A$
    \item Axiom 4: $\square A \rightarrow \square \square A$
    \item Axiom 5: $A \rightarrow \square \diamond A$
\end{itemize}
And what we can say about this axioms?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Axiom T, forces the relaiton R in the Kripke model to be \textit{reflexive}.
    \item Axiom 4, forces the relation R in the Kripke Model to be \textit{transitive}.
    \item Axiom D, forces the relation R in the Kripke model to be \textit{serial}.
    \item Axiom 5, forces the relation R in the Kripke model to be \textit{symmetric}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logics of Knowledge}

\textbf{Epistemic Modal Logic} where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\square$ is a Knowledge
    \item $\diamond$ is a Belief
\end{itemize}

this logic is useful when we want to reason inconsistencies.

\begin{itemize}
    \item If we know something, that is true
    \item If we know something, we know that we know something
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proof Theory, Deductive Systems in Modal Logic}

There are different deductive styles: sequent calculus, analytic tableaux, natural deduction.
And there are several approaches, including: labelled deductive systems and geometric/multidimensional deductive systems.
The desiderata is \textit{cut elimination/normalization and modularity}.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent
Another approach is \textbf{"Multidimensional"} systems, formulaes are enriches with a spatial coordinate (index/position)
that provies information within the proof.
In this way we can treat modalities in analogy as quantifiers are treated in first-orders systems.
Only modal operators can "change" the spatial position of the formulae.

\[\forall \leftrightarrow \square\]
\[\exists \leftrightarrow \diamond\]


\subsubsection{General Picture}

According to the assumption we make on the spatial coordinate $S$ of formulas $A^S$ we can "tune" the system to a specific (normal) modal logic:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ is a sequence: by seetting some constraints on the rule $\diamond E$ and $\diamond I$ one obtains all the logic from $K$ to $S4$
    \item $S$ is a set, one captures the system $S4.2$.
    \item $S$ is a singleton set: one captures $S5$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Position and modalities}

\begin{lemma}
    A formula $A$ interacts with a formula $B$ with respect to variable $x$ if $x$ occurs in free in both $A$ and $B$.
\end{lemma}
We have the possibility to add or remove the $\square$ operator through modal interaction, "playing" with the spatial coordinate and costraint.
\subsubsection{Position}

\begin{definition}
    A position is a \textit{sequence of uninterpreted tokens}.
\end{definition}
\noindent
We have associative concatenations and a Successor.

\subsection{What adds S4.2?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $S4.2 = S4 + \diamond \square A \rightarrow \square \diamond A (.2)$ 
\end{itemize}
This is still an enexplored country but this Logic describes Knowledge and Belief.

\subsection{Beyond S4: the Logic S5}

\begin{itemize}
    \item S5 = S4 + $\phi \rightarrow \square \diamond \phi \text{ or } K + T + D + \diamond A \rightarrow \square \diamond A$.
\end{itemize}
We obtain soundness and completeness $w.r.t$ Hilbert-style.

\subsection{Curry Howard Correspondence and the Intuitionistic}

Through BHK we can interpret proof as we can compute the proofs.
