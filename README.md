# Introduction

This collection of notes (Only in Italian) is made for everyone who wants to consult it. *These are notes are not in any way professional or
well corrected*, so don't expect maximum precision since these notes are took during lectures. I wrote notes for NOT all the courses in our program
for the only ones I knew I were able to code in TeX.
