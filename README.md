# Introduction

This collection of notes (only in Italian) is made for everyone who wants to consult it. *These notes are not in any way professional or
well corrected*, so don't expect maximum precision since these notes are took during lectures. I wrote notes for NOT all the courses in our program
but only for the ones I knew I were able to code in TeX.

## How to compile

In my notes I implemented some algorithms (Second Year/Algoritmi/OrderingAlgorithms) (where I'm trying to implement a video visualization with sdl2), if you want to compile while optimizing the code, here is the script:
```bash
make
```
and use
```bash
make clean
```
if you want to clean the directory from the binary files.

## Important contributors
